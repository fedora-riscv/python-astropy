Differences between upstream astropy and the current version python-astropy

Bundled python packages
=======================
Upstream astropy bundles several python packages under `astropy.extern`. 
The following packages have been unbundled and the code patched so that astropy
uses the system package:

 * configobj
 * six
 * ply
